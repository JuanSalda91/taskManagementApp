# Task Mnagament App

## Overview:

Build a Task Management App that allows users to add tasks with deadlines, assign categories, and update the status of each task. This app will require you to apply a wide range of JavaScript concepts, including arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, conditionals, and local storage to persist the task data.

## Objectives:

1. Add new tasks with details such as the task name, category, deadline, and status.
2. Update the status of tasks to reflect their progress (e.g., “In Progress,” “Completed,” “Overdue”).
3. Automatically update task status based on the current date (tasks past their deadline will be marked as “Overdue”). X
4. Filter tasks by status or category.
5. Persist task data using local storage so tasks are saved even after refreshing the page.

## Refelction

Building the task management app, the biggest challenge were the DOM updates, keeping data persistent with localStorage, and wiring filters and status changes wiithout breaking existing features. I approached them by breaking the work into tiny steps, writing psudocode for guidance, using console.log and double checking the loops and the conditionals to have a better understanding, also trying to test the features, then combined them and refactored names for clarity. If i had more time, I would definitely try to restructure my code looking for some simple a cleaner ways to do it and meet all the objectives.
